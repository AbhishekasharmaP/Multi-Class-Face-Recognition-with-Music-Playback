# Multi-Class Face Recognition with Personalized Music Playback

## Overview

This system combines real-time facial recognition with personalized music playback to create a unique user experience. A webcam captures live video, and deep learning models identify individuals within the frame. Based on the recognized faces, the system selects and plays music from pre-defined playlists associated with each person.

## System Components

- **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
- **Face Recognition**: Utilizes custom deep learning models similar to Siamese networks for accurate real-time facial recognition.
- **Music Playback**: Integrates with pre-made music playlists for personalized music selection based on identified individuals.

## Technical Approach

- Leverages deep learning techniques for robust and accurate facial recognition.
- Implements transfer learning with existing deep learning models (EfficientNet B0 with ImageNet weights) and custom techniques inspired by Siamese networks, including distance weighting and contribution factors for improved accuracy.
- Integrates with music streaming services or local music libraries.

## Benefits

- Offers a novel and interactive user experience with personalized music selection.
- Simplifies music selection by automatically tailoring it to the individuals present.

## Summary

This system demonstrates the potential of integrating facial recognition technology with other applications to create innovative and user-centric experiences. By personalizing music selection based on facial recognition, it provides a unique and engaging user interaction.
